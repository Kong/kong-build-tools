# openresty-build-tools

Reusable script for bootstrapping core components needed for Kong development.

This script builds different flavors of OpenSSL, OpenResty and LuaRocks depends on command
line arguments passed to it. It does this independently of what the base O/S library version
is so you always ends up with the same binary, every time.

# Synopsis
```
./kong-ngx-build -p buildroot --openresty 1.13.6.2 --openssl 1.1.1b --luarocks 3.0.4 --pcre 8.43 --debug
```

# Usage
```
$ ./kong-ngx-build -h
Build basic components (OpenResty, OpenSSL and LuaRocks) for Kong.

Usage: ./kong-ngx-build [options...] -p <prefix> --openresty <openresty_ver> --openssl <openssl_ver>

Required arguments:
  -p, --prefix <prefix>              Location where components should be installed.
      --openresty <openresty_ver>    Version of OpenResty to build, such as 1.13.6.2.
      --openssl <openssl_ver>        Version of OpenSSL to build, such as 1.1.1c.

Optional arguments:
      --no-openresty-patches         Do not apply openresty-patches while compiling OpenResty.
                                     (Patching is enabled by default)

      --no-kong-nginx-module         Do not include lua-kong-nginx-module while patching and compiling OpenResty.
                                     (Patching and compiling is enabled by default for OpenResty > 1.13.6.1)

      --kong-nginx-module <branch>   Specify a lua-kong-nginx-module branch to use when patching and compiling.
                                     (Defaults to "master")

      --luarocks <luarocks_ver>      Version of LuaRocks to build, such as 3.1.2. If absent, LuaRocks
                                     will not be built.

      --pcre <pcre_ver>              Version of PCRE to build, such as 8.43. If absent, PCRE will
                                     not be build.

      --add-module <module_path>     Path to additional NGINX module to be built. This option can be
                                     repeated and will be passed to NGINX's configure in the order
                                     they were specified.

      --debug                        Disable compile-time optimizations and memory pooling for NGINX,
                                     LuaJIT and OpenSSL to help debugging.

  -j, --jobs                         Concurrency level to use when building.
                                     (Defaults to number of CPU cores available: 12)

      --work <work>                  The working directory to use while compiling.
                                     (Defaults to "work")

  -f, --force                        Build from scratch.
                                     WARNING: This permanently removes everything inside the <work> and <prefix> directories.

  -h, --help                         Show this message.

Optional environment variables:

The following environment variables are likely only utilized when building for the purposes of packaging Kong

  LUAROCKS_INSTALL                 Overrides the `./config --prefix` value (default is `<prefix>/luarocks`)

  LUAROCKS_DESTDIR                 Overrides the `make install DESTDIR` (default is `/`)

  OPENRESTY_INSTALL                Overrides the `./config --prefix` value (default is `--prefix/openresty)

  OPENRESTY_DESTDIR                Overrides the `make install DESTDIR` (default is `/`)

  OPENSSL_INSTALL                  Overrides the `./config --prefix` value (default is `--prefix/openssl)

  OPENRESTY_RPATH                  Overrides the `make install DESTDIR` (default is `/`)

```

# Caching
This script supports two level of caching: artifact caching and build caching
in order to speed up re-compilation time for various different scenarios.

By default, both artifact caching and build caching are enabled.

Artifact caching checks the installation directory inside `prefix`, if that
directory is found, then it is assumed that software has been built already
and no more work is done on it.

Build caching saves the source code directory of the software to be built.
Repeated run will simply call `make` and `make install` again which supports
incremental rebuild Make provides. This is especially useful when developing
on OpenResty or NGINX C code.

If caching is undesirable or dependency version changed,
you can disable both caching with the `--force` option.

# Special notes for macOS users
`openresty-build-tools` needs a few utilities from the GNU `coreutils` suite to
run properly on a Mac. It can be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
easily:

```shell
$ brew install coreutils
```
